Purpose: Basic Python script that checks the CPU Temp with temp_str = os.popen('vcgencmd measure_temp').readline() and writes 
the current CPU temp to /temp.log with the time stamp. The length of the log file is also checked and once it reaches 1440 
lines the oldest line is removed. To edit this update this line: def manage_log_file(log_file, max_lines=1440):

Usage examples:
- Runs on Rapsberry Pi Zero W with Waveshare 3.7in E-Ink Display
